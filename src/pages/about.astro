				You may have seen me around previously on various social media
				platforms. While I stepped back from most social media when my second
				child was born, limiting my online presence primarily to Discord and
				Reddit, I still maintain this site to share my knowledge and
				experiences. For those who haven't encountered my work before, my name
				is Antonio, and I previously ran the Modern Cannabist pages across
				several platforms.

				Though I'm not actively posting on these channels anymore (other than youtube, still working on making new stuff for the channel), you can still
				find my archived content here:

	<p>
			My focus is sharing knowledge about biotically friendly farming methods, primarily for cannabis cultivation.
			My research and experimentation centers on enhancing cannabinoid and terpene production through targeted stimulation
			of plant defense mechanismsâ€”particularly those that activate fatty acid biosynthesis pathways.
	</p>

	<p>
			Don't worry if that sounds too technical! I aim to make this information accessible regardless of your experience level.
			Whether you're looking for straightforward guidance to produce high-quality cannabis in a safe, biointensive,
			and cost-effective way, or you're an experienced grower seeking advanced scientific approaches to refine your techniques,
			I've got content for you. My goal is to meet you where you are and provide valuable insights that can improve your growing practices.

	<h4>I was the person behind Modern Microbes</h4>

				As more growers began using my products, I received an increasing number
				of questions about this venture. Yes, I was the person behind Modern
				Microbes, which started as part one of the Modern Garden system back in
				2016.
			</p>

			<p>
				Modern Microbes began because I was frustrated with having to purchase
				mycorrhizae and nitrogen-fixing bacteria separately. While researching,
				I discovered that the industry standard nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
				Azospirillum Brasilense, was far from the most efficient option
				available and was rarely offered with complementary bacteria to form a
				complete consortium. I expanded my research into beneficial strains that
				could outcompete common garden pathogens like fusarium, botrytis, and
				rust, as well as into solubilizing bacteria that could unlock more
				nutrients from soil amendments and significantly increase yields.
			</p>

			<p>
				After extensive research and development, Modern Microbes was born as a
				comprehensive inoculant providing mycorrhizae, nitrogen fixers, and
				phosphorus, potassium, and silica solubilizing bacteria, along with
				protective bacterial and fungal strains to combat common garden
				pathogens.
			</p>

			<p>
				When my second child was born (of three), my priorities shifted
				dramatically. The demands of raising a growing family alongside managing
				Modern Microbes became unsustainable. With mixed emotions, I made the
				difficult decision to shutter the business and return to my roots in
				software design. While I miss the hands-on nature of working with
				biological systems, software development offers me the stability needed
				to support my family while still maintaining my passion for sustainable
				agriculture through educational content.
