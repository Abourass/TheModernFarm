Diving into probiotic gardening can feel like learning a new language at first. Whether you know it as probiotic, bio-intensive, or no-till growing, the techniques and terminology can seem overwhelming; especially when you're cultivating plants for your own medicine or depending on your garden for your livelihood. That's why I've created this straightforward introduction to simplify your journey. Consider this your friendly guide to getting started, and remember, if you have questions or need personalized advice, I'm just a message away on Discord.

### What does probiotic gardening mean?

This is one of the most common questions I'm asked, and for good reason. At its core, probiotic gardening focuses on cultivating beneficial soil microorganisms to create a thriving ecosystem that naturally supports plant health and growth. Because this term is an umbrella term for various practices aimed at enhancing soil health and plant vitality, it can encompass a range of techniques and philosophies.

The terminology in this field can be confusing because similar approaches go by different names. Whether labeled as probiotic, bio-intensive, or no-till growing, these methods all share a fundamental respect for soil biology. To clear up this confusion, I've researched the origins and relationships between these terms.

Here are the key concepts you should know (or at least look into):

* **KNF (Korean Natural Farming)** - A collection of farming techniques widely considered essential knowledge for probiotic farming practices. Many core probiotic gardening methods originated from KNF, including beneficial indigenous microorganisms and fermented plant extracts. While I haven't found definitive records of KNF's origins, [this resource provides excellent in-depth information](https://web.archive.org/web/20180124100226/http://theunconventionalfarmer.com:80/) [^1].

* **No-Till Farming** – The practice of planting crops without disturbing the existing soil structure, preserving the microbial and fungal networks below ground. No-till methods offer several scientifically proven benefits: increased carbon sequestration[^2] [^3], reduced fossil fuel usage[^3], minimized soil erosion[^4], and improved moisture retention compared to conventional practices[^4]. You can implement no-till in garden beds or even containers. For potted plants, choose larger containers (minimum 10-15 gallons), use mulch, and consider fabric or "breathing" pots for best results.

* **Probiotic Farming** – At its core, this approach focuses on creating and maintaining balanced bacterial and fungal communities in your soil. In practice, it combines several techniques:
  * Korean Natural Farming methods
  * Traditional organic practices like composting and aerated compost teas
  * ROLS (Recycled Organic Living Soil) or no-till approaches

  The term "probiotic" is familiar from foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and yogurt that contain beneficial bacteria. Similarly, probiotic farming reintroduces beneficial microorganisms to the soil, creating conditions that help them thrive. These soil-dwelling microbes do much of the work for you: breaking down nutrients, protecting plants from pathogens, and improving soil structure. Conventional agricultural practices often destroy these beneficial colonies, contributing to soil degradation and declining fertility[^5].

  **From Probiotic.com:**
  > Soil probiotics are commonly known as soil-based organisms (SBOs). SBOs are referred to as probiotics because they are beneficial bacteria that live in the soil. “Until the 19th century, when food processing replaced hand-to-mouth ingestion of raw fruit and vegetables, [SBOs] formed a regular part of our diet.” Soil based organisms are considered “friendly” non-resident or transient microorganisms. “Transient micro organisms are different from resident micro organisms in that they do not take up permanent residence in the gastrointestinal tract. Instead, they establish small colonies for brief periods of time before dying off or being flushed from the intestinal system via normal digestive processes, or by peristaltic bowel action.” Even though these types of beneficial bacteria are only in the digestive system on a temporary basis, “they contribute to the overall function and condition of the digestive system.”

### Common Acronyms

Check out this [wonderful PDF guide here](https://themodern.farm/studies/Soil%20Ecology%20Terms.pdf)!

* **IMO (Indigenous Microorganisms)** – Beneficial microbes collected from undisturbed local environments like forests or healthy soil ecosystems. These native organisms are already adapted to your local climate and can provide powerful support for your garden's soil food web. IMOs form the foundation of Korean Natural Farming practices and are particularly effective because they're pre-adapted to your specific growing conditions. Often used interchangeably with the next acronym, BIM.

* **BIM (Beneficial Indigenous Microorganisms)** – A more specific term for cultivated indigenous microbes that serve beneficial purposes in agriculture. The BIM cultivation process involves capturing wild microbes (using rice, other grains, or natural substrates), culturing them under controlled conditions, and introducing them to your garden. These beneficial colonies help decompose organic matter, improve nutrient cycling, suppress pathogens, and enhance plant resilience. [Learn how to make your own BIM cultures here](/TheModernFarm/tutorials/bim-culturing)

* **EWC** – Earthworm castings / compost – For a wonderful write up on the difference in vermicompost vs castings [read this article](/TheModernFarm/resources/vermicompost-vs-castings). I cannot overstate how SERIOUSLY important quality EWC is. If your soil is a house, the EWC & your compost are the foundation. I use Malibu Compost & EWC from Rocky Mountain EWC, in addition to whatever compost I make at home.

* **SST** – Sprouted Seed Tea – These provide hormones, amino acids, enzymes, and tons of other wonderful compounds. The most commonly used are barley (which I use mostly for amino acid content), corn (which I use for cytokinin content), and alfalfa (which I use mostly for triacontanol content). Great recipe on how to use, from Some Old Coot and can be found here.

* **SWC** – Seaweed Concentrate – Kelp, but treated with an acid to increase solubility. This akin to Orange Juice vs Tang, (Not sure who said that first, it was someone over at LOS Forum, cheers to them, it’s a perfect metaphor).

  Ascophyllum nodosum extracts contain various betaines and betaine-like compounds. In plants, betaines serve as a compatible solute that alleviates osmotic stress induced by salinity and drought stress; however, other roles have also been suggested, such as enhancing leaf chlorophyll content of plants following their treatment with seaweed extracts. Yield enhancement effects due to improved chlorophyll content in leaves of various crop plants have been attributed to the betaines present in the seaweed. It has been indicated that betaine may work as a nitrogen source when provided in low concentration and serve as an osmolyte at higher concentrations Betaines have been shown to play a part in successful formation of somatic embryos from cotyledonary tissues and mature seeds of tea. – The use of seaweed-based products from Ecklonia maxima and Ascophyllum nodosum as control agents for Meloidogyne chitwoodi and M. hapla on tomato plants

  Application of seaweeds and seaweed extracts triggers the growth of beneficial soil microbes and secretion of soil conditioning substances by these microbes. As mentioned, alginates affect soil properties and encourage growth of beneficial fungi. Ishii and others (2000) observed that alginate oligosaccharides, produced by enzymatic degradation of alginic acid mainly extracted from brown algae, significantly stimulated hyphal growth and elongation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and triggered their infectivity on trifoliate orange seedlings. – Seaweed Extracts as Biostimulants of Plant Growth and Development

* **LAB** – Lactobacillus Serum Click here for a guide to culturing LAB

* **EM-1** – Effective Microorganism. First defined by Teruo Higa in the paper: The Concept and Theories of Effective Microorganism

  Effective Microorganisms, aka EM Technology, is a trademarked term now commonly used to describe a proprietary blend of 3 or more types of predominantly anaerobic organisms that was originally marketed as EM-1™ Microbial Inoculant but is now marketed by a plethora of companies under various names, each with their own proprietary blend. “EM™ Technology” uses a laboratory cultured mixture of microorganisms consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria, purple bacteria, and yeast which co-exist for the benefit of whichever environment they are introduced, as has been claimed by the various em-like culture purveyors. It is reported to include:
  * Lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus plantarum; L. casei; Streptococcus Lactis.
  * Photosynthetic bacteria: Rhodopseudomonas palustris; Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
  * Yeast: Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Candida utilis (These species are no longer cultured for, but some some palustris does end up from the basic LAB process).
  * Actinomycetes (no longer used in the formulas): Streptomyces albus; S. griseus.

  So these days, for one reason or another, what is sold as EM-1 is Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodopseudomonas palustris.

  “Effective microorganisms make amino acids useful to plants, and organic acids, polysaccharides and vitamins strengthen their immune systems. EM1 consists of a water solution that contains compounds that promote nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, along with lactic bacteria, yeast and other components that these microorganisms need to live ” – (Shablin, 2006)

  Commonly, you will be referred here when you learn about EM-1. Which you will notice is the same recipe when we speak of LAB. This recipe gives you LAB, not EM-1, as there are no PNSB / Yeast.
  What is sold here is different then when we make LAB.

* **PNSB** – Purple Non-Sulphur Bacteria – Rhodopseudomonas palustris, and other purple non-sulphur bacteria are powerhouse of bioremediation, among so many uses It’ll take me a while to source all the relevant studies on it. Some quick highlights from a grower’s perspective, keeps stagnant water from becoming a death trap for clones & beginners that are over watering, eats algae, helps keep balance of ph in the medium esp. in the first cycle or two of the soil.

* **FPE** – Fermented Plant Extract – A great way to create a organic fertilizer for your garden. Wonderful introductions to this can be found here and another here.

* **AACT** – Actively Aerated Compost Tea – Sometimes people just write ACT, still referencing the same thing; brewing tea with some form of oxygen stimulation (bubblers, whirlpool). You can find recipe on the Methods page.

* **SAR** – Systemic Acquired Resistance – Please start by reading this journal . This is such a massive and important subject it will demand its own post.

* **IPM** – Integrated Pest Management – This is one of our primary ways of increasing SAR, and utilizing practice that make our gardens inhospitable to pest. To take your first steps down this road read here.

Less common:

* **SA** – Salicylic Acid
