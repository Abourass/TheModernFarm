If you've ever opened a so called "grow bible", you've likely come across some debates on the merits of 18hr of light vs 24hrs for vegging your plants. Common claims include "18 hours is more natural," "plants require darkness for certain metabolic processes," or simply "it saves electricity." While these explanations seem intuitive and practical, they oversimplify the complex plant biology at work. This article examines the science behind cannabis photoperiods to reveal why these conventional assumptions fall short and what actually determines optimal vegetative growth.

Let's examine why cannabis requires extensive light during vegetation. You may have read about pFr (phytochrome Far-Red) and its role in flowering signals. At its most basic, flowering begins when the protein pFr (a form of phytochrome, phytochrome Far-Red) accumulates. Phytochromes are soluble light-sensitive proteins that respond to red and far-red light wavelengths. The phytochrome form that absorbs red wavelength light is called Pr, or phytochrome red, while the form that reacts to far-red light is pFr, or phytochrome far-red. Biosynthesis begins of Pr during dark periods, and upon absorption of red light, Pr converts to Pfr.[^1] Less darkness means less Pr creation, resulting in less Pr converting to pFr. This fundamental process controls flowering initiation. Now, let's address the earlier misconceptions.

Regarding efficiency and electricity usage, the following research provides valuable insights. GW Pharma conducted a definitive study comparing 18-hour versus 24-hour light cycles during vegetation:

> "A GW Pharmaceuticals study compared the growth rates of eight varieties in day length of 18 and 24h. After three weeks the plant in the 18h day length were shorter and lighter than those in the 24h day length. .....
> To produce a similar mass of foliage to the plants that underwent 24hr day length for 21 day, the plants in the 18h group required 28 days, at which point the light energy emitted was the same for both plants, thus saving no electricity." –Handbook of Cannabis – Oxford Press, pg. 75

Having addressed two common misconceptions, let's examine the so-called "dark cycle." Importantly, what was once called the dark cycle is now termed the Calvin Cycle or Light-Independent Cycle, as scientists realized "Dark Cycle" created confusion by suggesting darkness was required. During photosynthesis, Light Cycle reactions and Calvin Cycle reactions typically occur simultaneously. While Light Cycle reactions require energy from UV photons, the Calvin Cycle functions independently of light presence whatsoever. I'll explore this topic more thoroughly in my upcoming article "Photosynthesis in Cannabis," which will cover chlorophyll transformations during curing, factors influencing plant coloration, and how specific lighting can enhance these visual characteristics.

I hope this information helps those deciding between 18-hour and 24-hour vegetative light cycles, and above all, satisfies your curiosity a little!
