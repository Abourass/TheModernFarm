Diving into probiotic gardening can feel like learning a new language at first. Whether you know it as probiotic, bio-intensive, or no-till growing, the techniques and terminology can seem overwhelming; especially when you're cultivating plants for your own medicine or depending on your garden for your livelihood. That's why I've created this straightforward introduction to simplify your journey. Consider this your friendly guide to getting started, and remember, if you have questions or need personalized advice, I'm just a message away on Discord.

### What does probiotic gardening mean?

This is one of the most common questions I'm asked, and for good reason. At its core, probiotic gardening focuses on cultivating beneficial soil microorganisms to create a thriving ecosystem that naturally supports plant health and growth. Because this term is an umbrella term for various practices aimed at enhancing soil health and plant vitality, it can encompass a range of techniques and philosophies.

The terminology in this field can be confusing because similar approaches go by different names. Whether labeled as probiotic, bio-intensive, or no-till growing, these methods all share a fundamental respect for soil biology. To clear up this confusion, I've researched the origins and relationships between these terms.

Here are the key concepts you should know (or at least look into):

* **KNF (Korean Natural Farming)** - A collection of farming techniques widely considered essential knowledge for probiotic farming practices. Many core probiotic gardening methods originated from KNF, including beneficial indigenous microorganisms and fermented plant extracts. While I haven't found definitive records of KNF's origins, [this resource provides excellent in-depth information](https://web.archive.org/web/20180124100226/http://theunconventionalfarmer.com:80/) [^1].

* **No-Till Farming** – The practice of planting crops without disturbing the existing soil structure, preserving the microbial and fungal networks below ground. No-till methods offer several scientifically proven benefits: increased carbon sequestration[^2] [^3], reduced fossil fuel usage[^3], minimized soil erosion[^4], and improved moisture retention compared to conventional practices[^4]. You can implement no-till in garden beds or even containers. For potted plants, choose larger containers (minimum 10-15 gallons), use mulch, and consider fabric or "breathing" pots for best results.

* **Probiotic Farming** – At its core, this approach focuses on creating and maintaining balanced bacterial and fungal communities in your soil. In practice, it combines several techniques:
  * Korean Natural Farming methods
  * Traditional organic practices like composting and aerated compost teas
  * ROLS (Recycled Organic Living Soil) or no-till approaches

  The term "probiotic" is familiar from foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, and yogurt that contain beneficial bacteria. Similarly, probiotic farming reintroduces beneficial microorganisms to the soil, creating conditions that help them thrive. These soil-dwelling microbes do much of the work for you: breaking down nutrients, protecting plants from pathogens, and improving soil structure. Conventional agricultural practices often destroy these beneficial colonies, contributing to soil degradation and declining fertility[^5].

  **From Probiotic.com:**
  > Soil probiotics are commonly known as soil-based organisms (SBOs). SBOs are referred to as probiotics because they are beneficial bacteria that live in the soil. “Until the 19th century, when food processing replaced hand-to-mouth ingestion of raw fruit and vegetables, [SBOs] formed a regular part of our diet.” Soil based organisms are considered “friendly” non-resident or transient microorganisms. “Transient micro organisms are different from resident micro organisms in that they do not take up permanent residence in the gastrointestinal tract. Instead, they establish small colonies for brief periods of time before dying off or being flushed from the intestinal system via normal digestive processes, or by peristaltic bowel action.” Even though these types of beneficial bacteria are only in the digestive system on a temporary basis, “they contribute to the overall function and condition of the digestive system.”
