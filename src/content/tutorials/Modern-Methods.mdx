### <a id="Soil"></a>Modern Mix V2.0

This is my personal soil blend. It's fairly simple to make, doesn't require more than 12 days time to be ready to use, and is was created for Probiotic/No-Till methodology. It's also quite economical, once you factor in multiple generations growing with it vs buying new soil every round. And of course, for those of you that are busy, [you can buy Modern Mix over at BuildASoil](http://buildasoil.com/products/modern-mix-v2-0-malibu-base). Oh, and on this page when it calls for an amendment or tea ingredient I use buildasoils brand unless otherwise noted. I do recommend their ingredients incredibly highly.

When finished preparing **Modern Mix** spray it down with **Modern Beginnings**, and then when it's dried up to where it's loamy / spongy and not over saturated with water, it's ready to use.

- **Base Soil**:
- 2 CuFt Sphagnum moss
- 1 CuFt Pumice
- 1 CuFt lava rock
- 1 CuFt Modern Beginning charged Biochar (thick pieces)
- 1 CuFt Rice Hulls
- 2 CuFt Humus composed of 1/3 Compost(Olly Mountain or Malibu Compost) and 2/3 EWC, and
- If on hand throw in a few handfuls some probiotic herbs – comfrey, nettle, dandelion, etc..

- **Amendments**:
- 1/2 cup organic Neem meal
- 1/2 cup organic Kelp meal

### <a id="Recycling"></a>Recycling Top Dress for Modern Mix

When you finish your plant leave the stump for 2 / 3 days, then give it a good rip out. It'll leave a sizeable hole, simply plop you next plant in the whole and topdress this recycling mix, then water in with Modern Beginnings. Throw the stump into a bokashi bin to make some awesome fungal compost.

- **Normal Recycling Mix**
- 6 cups of EWC (with comfrey mixed in if possible)
- 1/2 cup kelp meal
- 1/2 cup organic Neem meal
- 1/2 Cup Karanja Meal
- 1/3 Cup Insect Frass
- 1/3 cup crustacean meal
- 1/16th cup Modern Microbes
- 2 cups rock/mineral mix
- **(Per 2 cuFt of soil)**

- **Additional Recycling Mix – Only to be used every third recycling of the soil in addition to the normal Recycling Mix**
- 4 cup EWC
- 4 cup sphagnum moss
- 1/2 cup organic insect frass
- 1/2 cup crustacean Meal
- 1/3 cup Gro-Kashi
- 1/3 cup of fish bone meal
- 1/16th cup of Modern Microbes
- 1 cup of rock mix
- **(per 2 Cu Ft)**

- **Note from LOS forum ->** When breaking up the sphagnum moss break it up by hand, and then use a pump sprayer to moisten it with aloe and water. I generally take my time and spray, mix, spray, mix, etc until it's well hydrated. Then I measure it out in the same container I use to measure the compost/ewc and aeration

### <a id="IPM"></a>Integrated Pest Management

IPM stands for integrated pest management. I'd recommend spraying your plants with some variant of this twice a week in veg. I like to give them a pure water spray down every fourth foliar just to keep them from building up any residue. Give two clean water spray down's prior to switching to flower.

### Modern IPM

- **Natural Mystic** (from Dragonfly Earth Medicine) – 1.5 TSP per Gallon RO water, left to sit overnight in a dark space at 76 – 82 degrees. Do not add anything else to this yet, let it sit by itself overnight.
- **Insect Frass** – 1.5 TSP per Gallon RO water, added two hours before spray to the Natural Mystic Solution. Do not add anything else to this, let it sit two hours.
- **Essential Oil Blend** (from BuildASoil) – 1 TSP per Gallon RO added right before use.
- **Lavender Essential Oil** – 1 TSP per 2.5 Gallon RO added right before use.
- **Aloe Vera Powder** (from BuildASoil) – 1 TSP per Gallon RO added right before use
- **EM-1 / LAB** (Homemade, recipe coming soon) – 1 TBS per gallon RO added right before use
- **AgSil16** (from BuildASoil or KisOrganics) – 1.5 TSP per gallon RO added absolutely LAST
- **Neem Oil** (Cold Pressed, from BuildASoil) – 1 TSP per 2.5 gallon of RO water added right before use. (Only use Neem and Karanja Oil if you feel needed, such seeing the very beginning stages of plant warning signs others omit it)
- **Karanja Oil** (Ahimsa Organics Karanja Oil – OMRI Listed) – 1 TSP per 2.5 gallon of RO water added right before use. (Only use Neem and Karanja Oil if you feel needed, such seeing the very beginning stages of plant warning signs others omit it)
- Make sure the water is about 85 degree now (If possible). Shake / Stir everything until some foam appears on the top on the water. This will show the AgSil 16 / Aloe are emulsifying everything.
- If using HPS/MH water before lights off anytime you use Neem / Karanja Oil.

### <a id="SST"></a>ACT & SST

**ACT** stands for aerated compost tea, and it's invaluable in feeding your plants. Not only can you provide them with high bacterial/protozoan colony, you are giving them the nutrients in a available from without chelation (and with as long as you watch out for certain things, without salts).

**SST** stands for sprouted seed tea and it's just as useful as an ACT and even more powerful. You you utilize seed your tapping into huge wells of enzyme (a catalyst for further process, which acts by lessening the energy required form microlife to perform their task), and natural hormones. With these you can really help shape the plant, improve it's vigor, and really enliven the microlife in the soil.

### <a id="Clone"></a>Seed / Clone Juice

I've been asked a number of time what I do for my clones / seeds. I do not use rooting gel/powder as they have been shown to stick around in the final smoke, and not be something that's even needed. So instead here's what I use:

- **Water with no chlorine** – 1 Gallon
- **Aloe Vera 200x Organic Powder** (from build a soil) – 2 TSP
- **Coconut Water** – 1 TSP
- **Ful-Power** – 1/2 TBS
- **Modern Microbes** – 1 TSP
- Put all of this into the gallon of water a shake super well. Pour into a bowl and dip Rooter Riot plugs. When done pore excess water into tray, as the rooter riot will soak this up over time and with the PNSB your won't get algae. Cover with humidity dome / light. Keep warm but not hot. Voila, beautiful roots, nearly as fast as in a hydro cloner (yet this can be stay unplugged and not need checked on for days)
